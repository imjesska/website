###### Project Summary: Create a small website with at least 3 pages, implementing a clean HTML structure that follows the methodologies of visual design, and styling the site so that it is user-friendly.

**Work Flow**
>Site has at least 3 consistent pages with a dropdown menu and at lesast 10 different HTML tags
>
>Site implements at least 2 uses for forms and use regex validation 
>
>Use different types of content: text, images, web fonts, and GIFs
>
>Implement at least 5 different CSS selectors, a variety of inline, internal, and external styling as well

**Website Concepts:**

>-This pseudo-website is for my friend that sells her crafts as a side-gig. 
>
>-At the Shop page it will display some of her crafts, a description, last updated time it was posted, and if it's availble for purchase. Currently, the Buy Now button directs the user to her Etsy page.
>
>-At the About Me page it will display text descriptions and a table displaying contact information.
>
>-The FAQ page uses a table to display the most asked questions and the responses to them. One response directs the user to a different page to fill out a form if they live outside of the US and is interested in ordering.
>
>-The Contact Me page is just a form where the user gives feedback/comments.

**Notes/Comments:**

* [x] One of the requirements was to use HTML tables, so I implemented them in the About Me and FAQ 
* [x] Lorem ipsum is used throughout the site to demostrate how the layout and formatting looks
* [x] Loops, callbacks, and functions were all used to validate email for the forms
* [x] I did not implement the optional features of public API, AJAX, and JSON
* [x] Since we received more time to work on the website, I'm considering tweaking some features
* [x] The color scheme was intentional, I wanted to go with muted grays
